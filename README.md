During this project I learned quite a bit. Some of the major things including, movement and background. Try to get the player, snake, platforms, and background to change at the same time turned out to be difficult.
If I could do it again I would have spent less time on the snake character and getting it to chase the player and spend more time refining the overall mecahnics of the game.

The one major hurdle that I had for this project was the platforms. I was trying to get staggered platforms with different, reset times, collisons, widths, movement speeds, etc. I think I was overly ambious when I first started the project. I spent a long time jsut doing the same thing over and over again with minor differences, expecting a major change. Which didn't happen.

I would like to improve the platforms and the character movement. I think having better platforms would make the game better, but there was only so much I could do. As for the characters I would have liked to have some movement of the sprites involved. Looking at the same static sprites for hours took a toll on me. 

If I could do it again I would not have spent so much time coding and spend more on the ideas and basic functions before hand. I think I set my expectations to high and just continously slipped up on the coding side.

I stayed close to the deisgn document, but made quite a few changes while actuallt coding the project.

To stay on track I tried to seperate the code into sections and do what I could while giving myself some time to think about what I was doing. As you read earlier my time management with the platforms was the worst part, time wise.
